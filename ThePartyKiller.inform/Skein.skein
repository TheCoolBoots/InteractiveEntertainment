    <result xml:space="preserve">You are the ranger Thulmir and have just come across a stretch of forest that you have not explored in the decades of traveling across the continent. You naturally thought this impossible, as you are likely the greatest explorer or all time. Regardless, you are healthily skeptical of this forest and cautiously make your way through the dense undergrowth.&#x000A;&#x000A;In your backpack you carry your trusty repeating crossbow and a sleeping potion you were recently awarded by your friend, the mad wizard.&#x000A;&#x000A;ThePartyKiller&#x000A;An Interactive Fiction by Andrew Lai&#x000A;Release 1 / Serial number 220117 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD&#x000A;&#x000A;Forest Path&#x000A;This forest seems no different from the thousands of others you have traversed and cataloged in your time as an adventurer -- abundant in wildlife, the occasional magical beast charging towards you in a futile attempt to acquire dinner, patches of innocent-looking mushrooms, and more equally unexciting sights and sounds of the forest. However after a few hours of traveling, you hear something quite unusual.To the North you hear what can only be described as the echos of chaos. You hear the occasional breaking of glass, waves of laughter, explosions, and music reverberating through the trees.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Grand Entrance&#x000A;You push towards the noise and eventually come across a clearing in the forest. In front of you is something you never though you would find this deep in the forest: a Castle fit to be seiged upon by the greatest of Elder Dragons. It seems to be built with beautiful white stone and has spires reaching deep into the skies as if they dared clouds to come near them. The space in front of the castle is a massive lot, filled to the brim with chariots, carriages, and rickshaws pulled by everything from winged Griffons to armored beetles the size of cows. They must have come through a portal to get here. Ahead of you, towards the castle's grand entrance, a steady stream of people are heading into the colossus-sized double doors and a steady stream of apparent drunks are heading out, propped up by servants and companions alike. You walk up to the castle entrance. A Bouncer stands guard beside the doors and strangely enough, a gnome is strapped snugly to one of the neighboring pillars by rope. There is a gag over his mouth. The open doors North of you seem welcoming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Bouncer wears a crisp black tuxedo and has arms the size of tree trunks. He wears a festive party hat atop his head (a stark contrast to his stiff demeanor) and carries some kind of magical tablet with runes glowing on the back.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gnome is unconscious in his bindings. For some reason nobody pays him any attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">You walk up to the orc and immediately slap the drink he was enjoying to the ground. He turns to you and is initially confused. You can actually see the gears turning in his mind as the confusion turns to realization, and the realization turns to anger, and the anger turns to fury. He slams his fist into your face and you are sent flying backwards, slamming into a group of lovely ladies just trying to enjoy the evening. You notice you have just attracted the full attention of everyone around you. As if the crowd has practiced this, a ring of men appears around you and the orc as they give you space to exchange blows. One of the spectators speaks up:&#x000A;&#x000A;You know the drill, first to knock out your opponent wins. Loser forfeits their slot on the guest list. Aaaaaand FIGHT!&#x000A;&#x000A;Time slows down. You wonder, how did this happen? The ground vibrates as the orc begins charging towards you. Unafraid, you glance over your shoulder to see bags of coins changing hands as spectators predict the winner. When you turn back around, the Orc is just about breathing down your throat. Still in slow motion, you take a single perfect step to the right, steady yourself into a low martial stance, backed up by decades of training and practice, then lash out with your left leg, aiming for the orc's fragile kneecaps. The kick connects perfectly. The Orc's charge is promptly ended as his legs give out and his face slams into the floor with a resounding thud. Cheers erupt around you as coins once again change hands. Spectators crowd around you, slapping you on the back and giving their heartfelt congratulations. Someone offers you a mug of ale and while basking in the glory of your victory you drown it to thunderous applause. The party continues.&#x000A;&#x000A;You realize you're way to sober for this mission, and down the mug of ale. It is deliciously warm.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">You calmly walk up to the stage, starting at the left, and move from bard to bard, taking and smashing each of their instruments one by one. You can hear a collective gasp from the crowd as they realize what you are doing. After the last instrument is smashed into pieces, the drone of the party dies down to a whisper as the guests notice the absence of music. The relative silence is just becoming unbearable when the band leader steps forward and raises his fist up into the air. After a dramatic pause... he pulls out his powerful tenor from his soul and begins a powerful rendition of a fan favorite, Rohemian Bapsody. His band mates join him, then a woman in the front row lends her voice to the acapella, then her friends join her, then the whole dance floor, and soon enough, the thousands of party guests sing together in unison. It is truly inspiring. You forget what your mission is and have no choice but to join in on the singing. You are snapped back into reality when you are shoved off the stage by someone (you didn't catch who it was as you were caught up in the magic of the song), and you realize a barrier has been put up between you and the stage. From a secret passageway, servants bring out backup instruments just as majestic as the now destroyed ones.&#x000A;&#x000A;After a truly inspiring rendition of Rohemian Bapsody, the band re-dons their instruments and picks up right where they left off before the acapella.

    <command xml:space="preserve">take sleeping potion</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">You remember you found a powerful sleeping potion in the dungeon of a wizard who'd gone mad. You take it out of your back pocket, uncork the vial, and roll a nat 20 for sleight of hand to pour some of it into each barrel. You then begin lounging about waiting to see its effects. Slowly but surely partygoers fall to the ground unconscious as the potion is spread through the party. As people fall into a deep slumber, servants pick them up and drag them to some unseen sleeping room but are eventually overwhelmed by the sheer number of people passing out on the floor. Recognizing a change in mood, the bards start playing a peaceful lullaby. Next to you you see a young woman yawn. You are one of those people who can't help but catch others" yawns so you bring up your hand and let out a big long yawn. As you bring your hand to your face, you feel a dampness touch your lips. You lick your now damp upper lip and taste a pleasant cinnamon. Then your eyes begin to droop... You think, why am I so tired? And you decide the chair you are slumped in is the absolute most comfortable chair you have ever sat in. The band's lullaby suddenly sounds like the most beautiful sound you have ever heard, brighter than an angel's harp, warmer than a fire on a winter's night, calmer than the waves of a forest's lake. And you pass out.&#x000A;&#x000A;When you come to the party is back in full swing. The woman who you saw yawn was also just waking up. She says:&#x000A;&#x000A;That was the best sleep I've had in years! Wow I feel so alive! Please you must share a drunk with us.&#x000A;&#x000A;The woman stumbles back to her friends, who greet her with equally lively squeals then gesture you to join them.&#x000A;You realize you're way to sober for this mission, and down the offered mug of ale. It is deliciously warm.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">You walk up to the orc and immediately slap the drink he was enjoying to the ground. He turns to you and is initially confused. You can actually see the gears turning in his mind as the confusion turns to realization, and the realization turns to anger, and the anger turns to fury. He slams his fist into your face and you are sent flying backwards, slamming into a group of lovely ladies just trying to enjoy the evening. You notice you have just attracted the full attention of everyone around you. As if the crowd has practiced this, a ring of men appears around you and the orc as they give you space to exchange blows. One of the spectators speaks up:&#x000A;&#x000A;You know the drill, first to knock out your opponent wins. Loser forfeits their slot on the guest list. Aaaaaand FIGHT!&#x000A;&#x000A;Time slows down. You wonder, how did this happen? The ground vibrates as the orc begins charging towards you. Unafraid, you glance over your shoulder to see bags of coins changing hands as spectators predict the winner. When you turn back around, the Orc is just about breathing down your throat. Still in slow motion, you take a single perfect step to the right, steady yourself into a low martial stance, backed up by decades of training and practice, then lash out with your left leg, aiming for the orc's fragile kneecaps. The kick connects perfectly. The Orc's charge is promptly ended as his legs give out and his face slams into the floor with a resounding thud. Cheers erupt around you as coins once again change hands. Spectators crowd around you, slapping you on the back and giving their heartfelt congratulations. Someone offers you a mug of ale and while basking in the glory of your victory you drown it to thunderous applause. The party continues.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're starting to enjoy yourself. Best not to offend anyone by not enjoying this drink. You down it in a swift gulp.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You can actually see the gears turning in his mind as the confusion turns to realization, and the realization turns to anger, and the anger turns to fury. He slams his fist into your face and you are sent flying backwards, slamming into a group of lovely ladies just trying to enjoy the evening. You notice you have just attracted the full attention of everyone around you. As if the crowd has practiced this, a ring of men appears around you and the orc as they give you space to exchange blows. One of the spectators speaks up:&#x000A;&#x000A;You know the drill, first to knock out your opponent wins. Loser forfeits their slot on the guest list. Aaaaaand FIGHT!&#x000A;&#x000A;Time slows down. You wonder, how did this happen? The ground vibrates as the orc begins charging towards you. Unafraid, you glance over your shoulder to see bags of coins changing hands as spectators predict the winner. When you turn back around, the Orc is just about breathing down your throat. Still in slow motion, you take a single perfect step to the right, steady yourself into a low martial stance, backed up by decades of training and practice, then lash out with your left leg, aiming for the orc's fragile kneecaps. The kick connects perfectly. The Orc's charge is promptly ended as his legs give out and his face slams into the floor with a resounding thud. Cheers erupt around you as coins once again change hands. Spectators crowd around you, slapping you on the back and giving their heartfelt congratulations. Someone offers you a mug of ale and while basking in the glory of your victory you drown it to thunderous applause. The party continues.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You can hear a collective gasp from the crowd as they realize what you are doing. After the last instrument is smashed into pieces, the drone of the party dies down to a whisper as the guests notice the absence of music. The relative silence is just becoming unbearable when the band leader steps forward and raises his fist up into the air. After a dramatic pause... he pulls out his powerful tenor from his soul and begins a beautiful rendition of a fan favorite, Rohemian Bapsody. His band mates join him, then a woman in the front row lends her voice to the acapella, then her friends join her, then the whole dance floor, and soon enough, the thousands of party guests sing together in unison. It is truly inspiring. You forget what your mission is and have no choice but to join in on the singing. You are snapped back into reality when you are shoved off the stage by someone (you didn't catch who it was as you were caught up in the magic of the song), and you realize a barrier has been put up between you and the stage. From a secret passageway, servants bring out backup instruments just as majestic as the now destroyed ones.&#x000A;&#x000A;After a truly inspiring rendition of Rohemian Bapsody, the band re-dons their instruments and picks up right where they left off before the acapella.

You take it out of your back pocket, uncork the vial, and roll a nat 20 for sleight of hand to pour some of it into each barrel. You then begin lounging about waiting to see its effects. Slowly but surely partygoers fall to the ground unconscious as the potion is spread through the party. As people fall into a deep slumber, servants pick them up and drag them to some unseen sleeping room but are eventually overwhelmed by the sheer number of people passing out on the floor. Recognizing a change in mood, the bards start playing a peaceful lullaby. Next to you you see a young woman yawn. You are one of those people who can't help but catch others" yawns so you bring up your hand and let out a big long yawn. As you bring your hand to your face, you feel a dampness touch your lips. You lick your now damp upper lip and taste a pleasant cinnamon. Then your eyes begin to droop... You think, why am I so tired? And you decide the chair you are slumped in is the absolute most comfortable chair you have ever sat in. The band's lullaby suddenly sounds like the most beautiful sound you have ever heard, brighter than an angel's harp, warmer than a fire on a winter's night, calmer than the waves of a forest's lake. And you pass out.&#x000A;&#x000A;When you come to the party is back in full swing. The woman who you saw yawn was also just waking up. She says:&#x000A;&#x000A;That was the best sleep I've had in years! Wow I feel so alive!&#x000A;&#x000A;The woman stumbles back to her friends, who greet her with equally lively squeals.

    <command xml:space="preserve">take sleeping potion</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">You remember you found a powerful sleeping potion in the dungeon of a wizard who'd gone mad. You take it out of your back pocket, uncork the vial, and roll a nat 20 for sleight of hand to pour some of it into each barrel. You then begin lounging about waiting to see its effects. Slowly but surely partygoers fall to the ground unconscious as the potion is spread through the party. As people fall into a deep slumber, servants pick them up and drag them to some unseen sleeping room but are eventually overwhelmed by the sheer number of people passing out on the floor. Recongizing a change in mood, the bards start playing a peaceful lulaby. Next to you you see a young woman yawn. You are one of those people who can't help but catch others" yawns so you bring up your hand and let out a big long yawn. As you bring your hand to your face, you feel a dampness touch your lips. You lick your now damp upper lip and taste a pleasant cinammon. Then your eyes begin to droop... You think, why am I so tired? And you decide the chair you are slumped in is the absolute most comfortable chair you have ever sat in. The band's lulaby suddenly sounds like the most beautiful sound you have ever heard, brighter than an angel's harp, warmer than a fire on a winter's night, calmer than the waves of a forest's lake. And you pass out.&#x000A;&#x000A;When you come to the party is back in full swing. The woman who you saw yawn was also just waking up. She says:&#x000A;&#x000A;That was the best sleep I've had in years! Wow I feel so alive!&#x000A;&#x000A;The woman stumbles back to her friends, who greet her with equally lively squeals. The party continues.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The space in front of the castle is a massive parking lot, filled to the brim with chariots, carriages, and rickshaws pulled by everything from winged Gryffons to armored beetles the size of cows.

You can actually see the gears turning in his mind as the confusion turns to realization, and the realization turns to anger, and the anger turns to fury. He slams his fist into your face and you are sent flying backwards, slamming into a group of lovely ladies just trying to enjoy the evening. You notice you have just attracted the full attention of everyone around you. As if the crowd has practiced this, a ring of men appears around you and the orc as they give you space to exchange blows. One of the spectators speaks up:&#x000A;&#x000A;You know the drill, first to knock out your opponent wins. Loser forfeits their slot on the guest list. Aaaaaand FIGHT!&#x000A;&#x000A;Time slows down. You wonder, how did this happen? The ground vibrates as the orc begins charging towards you. Unafraid, you glance over your shoulder to see bags of coins changing hands as spectators predict the winner. When you turn back around, the Orc is just about breathing down your throat. Still in slow motion, you take a single perfect step to the right, steady yourself into a low martial stance, backed up by decades of training and practice, then lash out with your left leg, aiming for the orc's fragile kneecaps. The kick connects perfectly. The Orc's charge is promptly ended as his legs give out and his face slams into the floor with a resounding thud. Cheers erupt around you as coins once again change hands. Spectators crowd around you, slapping you on the back and giving their heartfelt congratulations. Someone offers you a mug of ale and while basking in the glory of your victory you drown it to thunderous applause. The party continues.&#x000A;&#x000A;You realize you're way to sober for this mission, and down the mug of ale. It is deliciously warm.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

For some reason nobody pays him any attention.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Come back later when you get an invitation." &#x000A;&#x000A;Just then you hear muffled mumblings from the man roped around the pillar beside you. You turn towards him and somehow feel your minds connecting; you think he cast a spell to communicate with you. Inside your head you hear:&#x000A;&#x000A;Are you the famous ranger Thulmir? It must be you - you stick out here like a sore thumb. Listen to me closely. This is my castle, my home, I started this party but it's gotten out of hand. Let me tell you, it has been going on for TWELVE WHOLE YEARS and I have tried every POSSIBLE WAY to get these AWFUL people out of my house! I will grant you riches BEYOND COMPREHENSION if you can just SHUT THIS PARTY DOWN. I'm begging you. Please help me. I just want a good night's sleep. In my fluffy bed. With my stuffed rhino. Here, I'll implant your name into the guest list so you can get in&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gnome closes his eyes for a moment and you see a bead of sweat trickle down his cheek. He opens his eyes and continues: Ok I put you in the system, the bouncer should let you in now. Do EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER to shut down this party. Don't even hesitate to get voilent. I promise to maintain your reputation no matter WHAT happens.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

As you turn towards the Entry Hall, the Gnome contacts you again:&#x000A;&#x000A;Wait wait wait! Get me down from here first!&#x000A;&#x000A;You decide he's already caused you enough trouble for you today. You end the telepathic link and continue on your way. Furious muffling can be heard from the Gnome's general direction.&#x000A;&#x000A;Grand Hall&#x000A;Spread before you is the party of a lifetime. The music surrounds you like a blanket, smothering your senses with its awesome power. Partygoers dressed in stunning costumes of brilliant color and variety peruse through groups of singers, dancers, drinkers, and chatters of equally dazzling quality. The west wing of the hall is the dance floor and the east wing is the bar and buffet.&#x000A;&#x000A;You stand there and take in your surroundings but all you can think about is why the hell you weren't invited... You remember the last time in a situation like this. Some hotshot fighter thought he could beat you in a brawl. Shame the constibles had to come to shut the thing down.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can pick out a head that stands out from the rest of the guests. He appears to be an orc and he does not look pretty, despite his best efforts.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see some other partygoers here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
